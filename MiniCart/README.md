##MiniCart Directive
The `<minicart>` directive can be used anywhere in the app.
The template `minicart.html` can and should be altered to best fit the customers specifications.
You will need to either `@import` the `minicart.LESS` file or include the `minicart.css` in your project.

It is expected that this directive will be customized.  It will likely not be perfect for your solution as is.
